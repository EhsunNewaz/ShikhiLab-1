    transcript: "One of the most memorable journeys I've ever taken was a trip to the Scottish Highlands a couple of years ago. I traveled there by train with two of my closest friends, which was an adventure in itself. The scenery from the train window was absolutely breathtaking, with rolling hills, vast lochs, and dramatic, misty mountains. We spent our days hiking through ancient forests and exploring historic castles. What made it so memorable was the feeling of complete freedom and being so close to nature. We were disconnected from our busy city lives, and the sheer scale and beauty of the landscape was truly humbling. The evenings were spent in a cozy cottage, sharing stories by the fireplace. It was a perfect escape and a journey I'll never forget.",

    transcript: "A book that I found particularly interesting is 'Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind' by Yuval Noah Harari. I read it over a summer holiday while I was traveling. The book provides a sweeping overview of human history, from the Stone Age right up to the present day. It made me feel incredibly small in the grand scheme of things, but also profoundly connected to the story of our species. What made it so fascinating was how it connected history, biology, and economics to explain how we came to be the dominant species on Earth. It challenged many of my preconceived notions about society and happiness. It's a book that truly changes the way you see the world, and I often find myself thinking about its ideas.",
